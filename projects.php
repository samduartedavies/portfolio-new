        <h3>Developer (freelance)</h3>
        <p>Alchemy RX was a one-page static site that I implemented as a remote freelancer. The project was a great success - with praise from both the agency that provided the project as well as the client. Praise included mentions of the final product going above and beyond the expected outcome accompanied by my ongoing hasty communications and detailed time logs of development.</p>

        <p>Allweather is a Roofing specialist advertising their services and information.

        <p>NPROXX is a German hydrogen storage company with multi-national clients; therefore, their website needed to be accessible to all their potential clients. A multi-lingual website was developed with every page having numerous versions of itself corresponding to the relevant language domain. SEO also needed to be refined to correctly display each language on relevant search criteria.</p>

        <p>My role in the development of this site included the opportunity to exercise my copy writing skills.

The development of this site was a purely static PHP site with Javascript/Jquery functionality.</p>
